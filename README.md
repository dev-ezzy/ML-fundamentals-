## Basics of building machine learning models
This small exercise is just to set a foundation on the most basic machine learning techniques and approach. It explains the simple steps of categorizing the target and feature variables, splitting the variables into train and test sets, transforming the data using a standard scaler and finally fitting and building a model

Although there is room for improvement on the model this is just a quick overview of what is expected of you when required to build, validate and evaluate a model for machine learning purposes.
